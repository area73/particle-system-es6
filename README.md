# PArticle System ES6 Object Oriented Vs Functional PAaadigm

This is a particle system, with no dependencies pure vanilla Javascript.

There are right now 3 branches:
  `version-0` is an Object Oriented ES6 clases & modules version. It is the minimum version 
    to work with .
    `version-0-functional` , same version but without classes and in a functional approach, not 
    optimised
    `version-1-functional`, more functional development this is the only branch that has a 
    dependence to  Ramda (a functional library), you can expect to find here free point programming,
     currying, etc.

## <a name="features">Features</a>
This is a very simple particle system with 3 actors.

**Particle:** the main object of this system that will be affected by forces.

**Emmisor:** Entity that will spell particles at diferent speed and angle

**Filed:** A gravity field. This gravity can be positive (it will attract particles), or negative
 (it will repel particles)
 
There are other pices to consider , the particle system itself were we set our scenario and a 
display system
