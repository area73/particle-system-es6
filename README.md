# Particle System:  ES6 Object Oriented Vs Functional Paradigm

This is a particle system, with no dependencies pure vanilla Javascript.

There are right now 3 branches:

  `version-0` is an Object Oriented ES6 classes & modules version. It is the minimum version 
   to work with .
    
  `version-0-functional` , same version but without classes and in a functional approach, not 
   optimised
    
  `version-1-functional`, more functional development this is the only branch that has a 
   dependence to  Ramda (a functional library), you can expect to find here free point 
   programming,
   currying, etc. 
   
   `talk/final`, `talk/stage-*` , functional and Object Oriented step by step for a talk 
    @functionalJS group

## <a name="features">Features</a>
This is a very simple particle system with 3 actors.

**Particle:** the main object of this system that will be affected by forces.

**Emmisor:** Entity that will spell particles at different speed and angle

**Filed:** A gravity field. This gravity can be positive (it will attract particles), or negative
 (it will repel particles)
 
There are other peaces to consider , the particle system itself were we set our scenario and a 
display system 

### <a name="patterns">Design Patterns</a>
This application contains a variety of design patterns to make the code readable and maintainable.

## <a name="Screenshots">Screenshots</a>
![Alt text](/assets/screen01.png?raw=true "Particle System")

## <a name="Getting-Started">Getting Started</a>
There is no need for a build or any package installation :scream_cat:

Just run the index.html on a modern browser and that's it.

All the imports are made with ES6 modules


### <a name="code-scaffolding">Code scaffolding</a>
<pre>
/root --> config files
  /assets --> images and static content
  /src --> this is were the code is located (functional , OO and Ramda library)
  /test --> testing files
</pre>

### <a name="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</a>
As I said before there is no need ot install any dependencies although this project has a package
.json to manage dev dependencies. This dev dependencies are related to eslint and prettier (tools
 for code linting and good practices)  

### <a name="installation">Installation</a>
None , hurrah !! :metal: :metal:


### <a name="start-server">Start the development server</a>

... but (there is always a but), you will need to run the index.html in a server because trying 
to execute index.html from file directory won't work since ES6 modules are sandbox to be executed
 in a server and not from file system.
 
 If you don't have any server you can run from the root of the project the following command:
 
 `npx simple-server`

## <a name="Running-the-tests">Running the tests</a>
I'm using Jest to do the testing. You can do:

`npm run test`

## <a name="Built-With">Built With</a>
Good old plain Javascript
